<p>The screen based interface that will be evaluated is Skyrim on PC. Skyrim uses the same UI for PC and console. Many reviews for the PC version suggest that while this UI may be easy to use on console it can be unintuitive on PC.</p>

<p>The video above shows the menu screens being navigated using a mouse.</p>
<p>
 A further reason for evaluating Skyrim's interface is that currently two of the most endorsed Skyrim mods on <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/topalltime/?adult=2">Nexus</a> alter the UI of the game in some way. </p>
 <img src="images/top-mods.PNG" alt="Nexus mods">
 <p> The most popular one, SkyUI, overhauls many of the menu screens in the existing interface. SkyUI describes itself as a "PC friendly UI mod for Skyrim" suggesting the creators don't think the UI is already "PC friendly". </p>

<h3 id="heuristics_analysis">Heuristics Analysis - Qualitative </h3>
<p> The heuristics used were <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1357282&CFID=847718075&CFTOKEN=29288463">Pinelle's heuristics for video games</a> and  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's heuristics for User Interface Design.</a>
<p> Pinelle's defines "game usability as the degree to which a player is able to learn, control, and understand a game".</p>

    <td>The consistency of the responses depends on the user's input. Switching between input methods for the menu screens for example switching between mouse and keyboard. </td>

    <td>On PC Skyrim auto-detects the ideal video and audio settings and sets them. There is also the option to manually change any of those settings, however changing them above what the computer can
    run will effect how the game runs potentially making it unplayable.</td>

<h3 id="focus_groups">Focus Groups - Quantitative</h3>
<p> A survey was used to gain quantitative answers about people opinions on the Skyrim UI. Each question was multiple choice or a rating on a scale of one to five. </p>
<p>The first question was asking participants how important they found the menu UI in a game to be on a scale of 1 to 5,1 being unimportant and 5 being very important. The mean result was 4.24, as the result is skewered towards the higher end of the scale this suggests most participants find the game UI important.

<center><p><em>Graph showing how important participants find game UIs</em></p></center></p>
<h4></h4>
<p> Only 26.7% of participants said they had used UI mods on Skyrim. This low number could be due to them playing on console and therefore not having the option for UI mods or it could be due to them being content with the default UI. 
 

<p>Issues - questions could be bias, people could be bias, questionnaire restricts data given?</p>
