<p>The screen based interface that will be evaluated is Skyrim on PC. Skyrim uses the same UI for PC and console. Many reviews for the PC version suggest that while this UI may be easy to use on console it can be unintuitive on PC.</p>

<p>The video above shows the menu screens being navigated on PC using a mouse. </p>
<p>
 A further reason for evaluating Skyrim's interface is that currently two of the most endorsed Skyrim mods on <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/topalltime/?adult=2">Nexus</a> alter the UI of the game in some way. </p>
 <img src="images/top-mods.PNG" alt="Nexus mods">
 <p> The most popular one, SkyUI, overhauls many of the menu screens in the existing interface. SkyUI describes itself as a "PC friendly UI mod for Skyrim" suggesting the creators don't think the UI is already "PC friendly". </p>

<h2 id="heuristics_analysis">Heuristics Analysis - Qualitative </h2>
<p> The heuristics used were <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1357282&CFID=847718075&CFTOKEN=29288463">Pinelle's heuristics for video games</a> and  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's heuristics for User Interface Design.</a>  Pinelle's defines "game usability as the degree to which a player is able to learn, control, and understand a game".</p>

<h4>Provide consistent responses to the user’s actions. </h4>
 The consistency of the responses depends on the user's input. Switching between input methods for the menu screens for example switching between mouse and keyboard can cause strange results where the wrong option is selected because the mouse was resting on one option and the arrows being used to to get another.. 
    
<h4>Allow users to customize video and audio settings, difficulty and game speed</h4>
 On PC Skyrim auto-detects the ideal video and audio settings and sets them. There is also the option to manually change any of those settings, however changing them above what the computer can run will effect how the game runs potentially making it unplayable.
 Audio and video settings can only changed before the game is launched using a separate tool or once them is running from the pause menu. The image below shows the pause menu where the player can access sub menus for settings for audio, visual and game play.

<h4>Provide unobstructed views that are appropriate for the user’s current actions and Provide users with information on game status.</h4>
The compass at the top of the screen shows nearby landmarks and currently marked quests at all times. 
<img src="images/ingame-ui.jpg" alt="in game">
The part of the UI showing the health, magicka and stamina levels only show when in combat or when they're decreasing. However if the player is being affected by something such as poison or a spell it isn't always clear the player has to check in a menu to see what effects are active on them. 

<h4>Provide intuitive and customizable input mappings and Provide controls that are easy to manage, and that have an appropriate level of sensitivity and responsiveness.  </h4> </h4>

<h4>Provide instructions, training, and help.</h4>
The game starts for a tutorial teaching players the basic controls however some in game systems aren't explained and have to be learned through playing the game.

<br />
<h2 id="focus_groups">Focus Groups - Quantitative</h2>
<p> A survey was used to gain quantitative answers about people opinions on the Skyrim UI. Each question was multiple choice or a rating on a scale of one to five. </p>
<p>The first question was asking participants how important they found the menu UI in a game to be on a scale of 1 to 5,1 being unimportant and 5 being very important. The mean result was 4.24, as the result is skewered towards the higher end of the scale this suggests most participants find the game UI important.

<h4></h4>
<p> Only 26.7% of participants said they had used UI mods on Skyrim. This low number could be due to them playing on console and therefore not having the option for UI mods or it could be due to them being content with the default UI. 

<p>When asked how much they think UI improve the UI on a scale of 1 to 5 one being they make no difference and 5 being they improve the game a lot. The average answer was 3.75 suggesting that a majority of participants believed that using UI mods improved Skyrim.

<p>The image below shows an example of a UI mod called SkyUI, it's the most popular mod for Skyrim on nexus.</p>

<p>Issues - questions could be bias, people could be bias, questionnaire restricts data given?</p>
