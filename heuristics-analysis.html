<p> The first evaluation method is a heuristics analysis. This is a qualitative method that looks at whether Skyrim meets all the chosen heuristics.  The heuristics used are <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1357282&CFID=847718075&CFTOKEN=29288463">Pinelle's heuristics for video games</a>. These heuristics were specifically designed for game usability.  Pinelle defines "game usability as the degree to which a player is able to learn, control, and understand a game”.  The method used is <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/">Nielsen’s</a>. Nielsen says that a heuristics analysis should be carried out by a "small set of evaluators" to maximise the number of issues found however due to time constraints I carried out the analysis myself. This means that some issues will be missed.
</p>
<p> A heuristics analysis will be conducted on both Skyrim and the SkyUI mod.</p>

<h4>Provide consistent responses to the user’s actions. </h4>
<p>
In Skyrim the consistency of the responses often depends on the user and their input device. An Xbox controller will likely give consistent results however there are some issues when using a mouse and keyboard. For example, switching between mouse and keyboard in the menu or inventory screens can cause strange results where the wrong option is selected because the mouse was resting on one option and the arrows being used to get another. A way to improve this would be to only allow one method such as the mouse to be used in the menu screens, this would prevent any inconsistent results. The input devices are the same for both Skyrim and SkyUI so both provide similar responses.
</p>

<h4>Allow users to customize video and audio settings, difficulty and game speed</h4>
 On PC Skyrim auto-detects the ideal video and audio settings and sets them. There is also the option to manually change any of those settings, however changing them above what the computer can run will effect how the game runs potentially making it unplayable.
 Audio and video settings can only changed before the game is launched using a separate tool or once them is running from the pause menu. The image below shows the pause menu where the player can access sub menus for settings for audio, visual and game play.

The combination of both auto detect and customising the controls allows players to just start the game without altering settings or allow other players to customise their settings.

<h4>Provide unobstructed views that are appropriate for the user’s current actions and Provide users with information on game status.</h4>
The compass at the top of the screen shows nearby landmarks and currently marked quests at all times.

The part of the UI showing the health, magicka and stamina levels only show when in combat or when they're decreasing. However if the player is being affected by something such as poison or a spell it isn't always clear the player has to check in a menu to see what effects are active on them. This is another areas addressed by popular UI mods such as SkyUI, the mods displayed active effects on the character on screen allowing the user to clearly see the character's status, changes like this could be implemented in the base game.

<h4>Provide intuitive and customizable input mappings and Provide controls that are easy to manage, and that have an appropriate level of sensitivity and responsiveness.</h4>
<img src="images/controls-menu.jpg" alt="controls">
The keyboard controls are easily changed in an in game menu for controls, there's also a game play menu that allows for axis inverting and mouse sensitivity altering. Both these features imrpove the usability of the game allowing players to tailor the input settings to their play style.


<h4>Provide instructions, training, and help.</h4>
The game starts for a tutorial teaching players the basic controls however some in game systems aren't explained and have to be learned through playing the game.
