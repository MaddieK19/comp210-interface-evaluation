<p> The quantitative method used was an online survey on Skyrim's UI using mulitple choice questions or likert scales. Each question was multiple choice or a rating on a scale of one to five. A likert scale was used as according to <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2160721&CFID=681930977&CFTOKEN=52733539">Robertson</a> they are commonly used to evaluate Human Computer Interaction and <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1753686&CFID=681930977&CFTOKEN=52733539">Kaptein <em>et al </em> </a>  says that they can be a good way to collect data for the usabilty evaluations. However they can give invalid data when there are small numbers of  particpants. My survey only received 17 responses most of which were from people familar with the game so may not be valid. Also after reviewing the questionnaire some of the questionas appeared either bias or too vaugue, to solve this in the future I would make another version of the questionaire with more approriate questions that would collect better data. The second questionnaire would also contain more questions about the use of UI mods to compare two versions of the Skyrim UI.</p>

<br />

<p>The first question was asking participants how important they find the menu UI in video games. This question was to judge how important particiapnts find the game UIs as if they had no interest in the subject their answers may not be as relevant. The mean result was 4.24, as the result is skewered towards the higher end of the scale this suggests most participants find the game UI important.

<br />

<p> Only 26.7% of participants said they had used UI mods on Skyrim. This low number could be due to them playing on console and therefore not having the option for UI mods or it could be due to them being content with the default UI. </p>

<p>When asked how much they think UI improve the UI on a scale of 1 to 5 one being they make no difference and 5 being they improve the game a lot. The average answer was 3.75 suggesting that a majority of participants believed that using UI mods improved Skyrim.

<p>The image below shows an example of a UI mod called SkyUI, it's the most popular mod for Skyrim on nexus.</p>

 <p>When asked how easy participants find Skyrim's UI to navigate on a scale of 1 to 5 the answers ranged from 2 to 5. The average was 3.59,  this answer varied a lot meaning it's unclear whether Skyrim's UI is easy to use or not.</p>

 <p>The final question was whether participants thought Skyrim gave them tutorials and help in game, again there was a wide range of answers from 2 to 5 and the average was 3.0. This variety could be caused by users skipping parts of the tutorial or from having previous experience with the series.</p>

<p>Possible issues with the answers given by participants are firstly that only 17 people took part, this small sample size means answers may not be valid for a larger group. Secondly the answers are all numerical or multiple choice meaning what factors lead to those answers aren't there. Finally while many of the questions where based on Pinelle's heuristics they could be written in a bias way that effects the answers</p>
