<p> The quantitative method used was an online survey on Skyrim's UI using multiple choice questions or Likert scales. A Likert scale was used as according to <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=2160721&CFID=681930977&CFTOKEN=52733539">Robertson</a> they are commonly used to evaluate Human Computer Interaction and <a href="http://dl.acm.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/citation.cfm?id=1753686&CFID=681930977&CFTOKEN=52733539">Kaptein <em>et al </em> </a>  says that they can be a good way to collect data for usability evaluations. However, they can give invalid data when there are small numbers of participants. My survey only received 17 responses most of which were from people familiar with the game so may not be valid.
Also after reviewing the questionnaire some of the questions appeared either bias or too vague, to solve this in the future I would make another version of the questionnaire with more appropriate questions that would collect better data. The second questionnaire would also contain more questions about the use of UI modifications to compare two versions of the Skyrim UI. I would also try to get more responses.</p>

<br />

<p>The first question was asking participants how important they find the menu UI in video games. This question was to judge how important participants found the game UIs as if they had no interest in the subject their answers may not be as relevant. The mean result was 4.24, as the result is towards the higher end of the scale this suggests most participants find the game UI important.

<br />

<p> The next question asked participants if they had used UI modifications on Skyrim before. Only 26.7% of participants said they had ,this low number could be due to them playing on console and therefore not having the option for UI modifications or it could be due to them being content with the default UI.  In the future the questionnaire could be improved by being specific to Skyrim on PC and not other platforms, this would give more valid data about the use of modifications. </p>

<p>When asked how much they think UI modifications improve the game on a Likert scale up to 5, the average answer was 3.75. As this is near the centre it suggests participants were either neutral or thought that modifications do improve the game.  Again a larger sample size would give more valid results. Also what makes a good UI likely varies from person to person. As mentioned in the heuristics analysis SkyUI adds in symbols that may confuse some players but aid others so there may be no clear answer on whether UI modifications do improve the interface of Skyrim.

<p> The heuristics analysis suggested that altering the video and audio settings in Skyrim is simple to do through the pause menu. The next questions asked participants whether they found it easy to alter the video and audio settings. The mean result was 3.8 suggesting that the settings are easy to alter. Again this question did not take into account what platform participants were playing the game on. This could make the results invalid as for example console version will likely have a lot less video and audio settings than the PC version.</p>

 <p>Participants were also asked whether they found Skyrimâ€™s UI easy to navigate. The question was likely too vague, it would have been better to ask the participants whether they could perform certain tasks by navigating the UI as this would have been more specific. This question also used a Likert scale and the answers ranged from 2 to 5. The average was 3.59, the answers varied a lot meaning it's unclear whether Skyrim's UI is easy to use or not. A larger sample size could be used to gather more data and hopefully clearer results.

<br/>
 <p>The final question was whether participants thought Skyrim gave them enough tutorials and help in game. Again there was a wide range of answers from 2 to 5 and the mean was 3.0. This variety could be caused by numerous factors ranging from users skipping parts of the tutorial or from having previous experience with the Elder Scrolls series therefore having some knowledge of how the UI works.</p>
<br/>
<p>Possible issues with the information gained from this survey are firstly that only 17 people responded. This small sample size means answers may not be valid for a larger group. Secondly the answers are all numerical or multiple choice meaning the factors that lead to answers given were not considered, adding the option to add comments may have gained more data and added insight to some of the answers. Finally, while some of the questions were based around Pinelle's heuristics they could be written in a bias or vague way that effected the answers.</p>
<p>The heuristics analysis suggested that the changes made by SkyUI improved Skyrim's user interface. The data gained from the survey often gave varied answers and while it suggested that UI modifications improved the interface there were not enough particpants and data to confirm that.</p>
